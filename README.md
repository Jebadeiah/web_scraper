This is a simple web scraper that I'm writing as I follow along with the project on Jetbrains Academy.

There are alot of files in here outside of what I've written, as it includes many test files from Jetbrains Academy. The project file can be found in the following path - 
web_scraper > Web Scraper > Web Scraper > task

There are also problems that I solved while working on this project. Those can be found in the following path - 
web_scraper > Web Scraper > Problems
